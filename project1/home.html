        <h2>History of Nassau</h2>
        <p>Nassau has a rich history that dates back to its founding in 1670. Originally a settlement for the British, Nassau became a hub for pirates during the 18th century. Its colonial past is reflected in the architecture, such as the iconic Government House and Fort Fincastle. Over time, Nassau evolved into a bustling port city and eventually the capital of The Bahamas.</p>
